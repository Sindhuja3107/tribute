        <h2>About Nelson Mandela</h2>
        <p>
            Nelson Mandela, born in 1918, was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist 
            who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first 
            elected in a fully representative democratic election.
        </p>

        <p>
            What I admire most about Mandela is his resilience and unyielding dedication to justice. He spent 27 years in prison and 
            still emerged with a message of peace and reconciliation. His life story teaches us the power of forgiveness and the 
            strength of the human spirit.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Mandela received over 250 honors, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He remains a global icon of peace and social justice. 
            His life and words continue to inspire millions across the world to stand for equality and human rights.
